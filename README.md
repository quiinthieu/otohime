# Otohime

Personal site for [otohime.dev](https://otohime.dev). One Next.js app serves the pages and the API. Postgres holds accounts and app data.

## Local setup

```bash
bash scripts/dev.sh
```

That creates `.env` if needed (including `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`), starts Postgres, applies migrations, and runs Next.js. The app listens on port **4000** by default (`http://localhost:4000`) so it stays outside the mini-app range **3000–3098**. Postgres listens on **5433**.

`BOOTSTRAP_ONLY=1 bash scripts/dev.sh` prepares the database and exits without starting the app. `SKIP_BROWSER=1` skips opening a tab.

The script raises Node's HTTP header size so mini-app cookies on `localhost` do not produce a blank 431 page.

## Layout

```
app/            pages and route handlers
lib/auth.ts     Better Auth
db/             Drizzle schema, client, and migrations
```

The browser talks only to this Next.js server. `lib/` and `db/` are the only code that opens Postgres.
