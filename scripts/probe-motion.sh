# At 1366x768 and at 390x844 (isMobile, hasTouch) it clicks the real links /projects -> each of the eight
# projects, /shore -> /projects and /orrery/sun -> /planisphere (Orrery's "Next door"). pageswap on the old page
# and pagereveal on the new one must both carry a viewTransition, and each document names at most one element
# project-*. Under reduced motion the same hops complete, and every animation at load lasts at most 1 ms or has
# finished. No console error and no page error anywhere. Negative check: with @view-transition stripped from
# the CSS /shore loads (page.route), the /projects -> /shore hop must reveal with no transition.
# Group swaps: leaving the 404 (by its Go home and the brand mark), /work -> /, / -> /work (the console),
# /work -> /sign-in and /sign-in -> / each fade the old page out and the new one in; a hop from /shore into the
# 404 carries the transition with no page error; with JavaScript off the 404's Go home goes to /.

# Env: PORT (4061; a port Next reserves is bumped by 10), BASE_URL (remote mode), SKIP_BUILD=1.
# Playwright is installed into a temp prefix at run time; package.json stays unchanged.
