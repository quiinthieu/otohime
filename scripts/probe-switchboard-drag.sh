# On / at 1366x768 (mouse) and 390x844 (real touch through CDP), light and dark: a drag from the plug to the
# Telegram jack connects Telegram (readout, Line stat, chip pressed, then "picked up" and an Open Telegram link to
# t.me); a drop just inside the fourteen-unit snap radius connects and one just outside misses; a miss and a
# pointercancel spring the plug home in about six frames (several distinct in-between positions, home within
# 1 s) with the line untouched; the finger drag does not scroll the page and a finger elsewhere on the figure
# still does. The chips still work by keyboard with focus kept on the chip, the screen-reader links take focus,
# and no drag, chip or Open link render navigates or opens a page (outside requests are blocked and counted).
# Under reduced motion (from load and switched on live) a miss is home on the next frame. Negative control: with
# getScreenCTM knocked out the same drag-to-Telegram check fails. No console or page error anywhere.
#
# Env: PORT (4087, or a free port when that default is busy; a port Next reserves is bumped by 10), BASE_URL (remote mode), SKIP_BUILD=1, EXPECT_SHA (checked if set),
# SHOTS=<dir> to keep screenshots for a look (never committed).
# Playwright is installed into a temp prefix at run time; package.json stays unchanged.
# No `set -e`: every check runs, and the summary names the ones that failed.
